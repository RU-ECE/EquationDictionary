# Equation Dictionary

This is a model for an equation dictionary. At the top level, we have links to
each page. This is not an efficient implementation, so this is just a template.
In the future, a PDOC implementation could implement this as a binary file with all
equations linked, then a secondary encyclopedia where all the equations are amplified.

Equation List (this might be too big and unwieldy?)
[Bolzmann Equation](bolzmann.md)
[Navier-Stokes Equation](n-s.md)

Should we have categories? This is important in a system that is huge.
What do we do when an equation crosses fields? Some wave equations are used in water dynamics and electrical engineering.
