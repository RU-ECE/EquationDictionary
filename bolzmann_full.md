## Technical Description

<!-- Complete the sections on Technical Description (for an audience who know differential and integral calculus, algebra, trig, and general first year engineering knowledge -->

The Boltzmann equation is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of the single-particle distribution function in a dilute gas. It combines:

**Left-hand side terms:**
1. **Convective term** $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$: Local time derivative representing accumulation/depletion at a fixed point in phase space
2. **Advection term** $\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla f$: Spatial transport due to particle motion through position space
3. **Force term** $\frac{\mathbf{F}}{m} \cdot \nabla_v f$: Acceleration in velocity space due to external forces (gravity, electromagnetic fields, etc.)

**Right-hand side:**
- **Collision integral** $\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_\text{coll}$: Net effect of binary collisions between particles, typically written as:
  $$\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_\text{coll} = \int d^3v_1 \int d\Omega \, \sigma(\Omega) |\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{v}_1| [f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}', t) f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}_1', t) - f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}, t) f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}_1, t)]$$

Where $\sigma(\Omega)$ is the differential scattering cross-section, and primed velocities represent post-collision states.

**Physical interpretation:** The equation states that the total rate of change of particles at a point in phase space equals the net rate of particles entering/leaving due to collisions. This conservation principle leads to the H-theorem, establishing the irreversible nature of macroscopic processes and the second law of thermodynamics.

**Solution methods:** Analytical solutions exist only for special cases (Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at equilibrium). Numerical methods include Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and lattice Boltzmann methods for computational fluid dynamics applications.

## General Explanation

<!-- Write a general description, including a comment with the prompt, explaining to a general audience with an 8th grade vocabulary -->

Imagine you're watching a crowd of people moving around in a large room. The Boltzmann equation is like a rulebook that tells you how the crowd changes over time. Here's what it means in simple terms:

**What it tracks:** The equation keeps track of how many particles (like gas molecules or people) are at each location and moving at each speed at any given moment.

**Why it matters:** This helps scientists understand how gases behave, how heat flows, and why things like air pressure and temperature work the way they do.

**The three main parts:**
1. **Time changes:** How the crowd changes from moment to moment
2. **Movement:** How people spread out as they walk around the room
3. **Forces:** How things like gravity or magnets push people in certain directions

**The tricky part:** The right side of the equation deals with what happens when particles bump into each other - like when people in a crowd collide and change direction.

**Real-world uses:** This equation helps engineers design better engines, predict weather patterns, and understand how heat moves through materials. It's one of the most important equations in physics for understanding how the world works at the microscopic level.
